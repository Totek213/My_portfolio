# NewsSense AI: Your Smart News Curator

NewsSense AI is a conceptual project for a personalized news assistant that leverages Machine Learning (ML) to filter content, summarize articles, identify key topics, and help users navigate the vast amount of daily information.

This repository contains a simplified Python implementation demonstrating the core ML functionalities of such a bot.

## üöÄ Features (Simplified Implementation)

* **Article Retrieval (Simulated):** Reads from a predefined list of article texts.
* **Automatic Text Summarization:** Generates concise summaries of articles using an extractive method (LSA).
* **Topic Modeling:** Identifies overarching themes within articles using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
* **Basic Recommendation System:** Provides article recommendations based on detected topics and a user's preferred topic (a highly simplified version of a real recommendation engine).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Python 3.x**
* **`sumy`**: For text summarization (LSA algorithm).
* **`gensim`**: For topic modeling (LDA).
* **`nltk`**: For natural language processing tasks like tokenization and lemmatization.
* **`pandas`**: For efficient data handling and article management.
* **`scikit-learn`**: (Included for potential future expansion, not directly used in the basic ML pipeline here).

## üíª Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (or copy the code):**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-link> # (If this were a real repo)
    cd news-sense-ai          # (If you cloned it)
    ```
2.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install sumy gensim nltk pandas scikit-learn
    ```
3.  **Download NLTK data:**
    You'll need the `punkt` and `wordnet` tokenizers for NLTK. Run this command in your Python environment:
    ```python
    import nltk
    nltk.download('punkt')
    nltk.download('wordnet')
    ```

## üöÄ How to Run

1.  **Execute the Python script:**
    ```bash
    python news_sense_ai.py
    ```
2.  **Follow the on-screen menu:**
    The bot will present a console menu allowing you to:
    * Display all available articles and their summaries.
    * View the detected topics for a specific article ID.
    * Get recommendations by specifying a preferred topic ID (0, 1, 2, etc.) or choosing 'none' for general recommendations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Structure (Conceptual)

While this example is a single script, a full-fledged NewsSense AI system would likely have a more complex architecture:
