# 🤖 GPT LLM Chatbot

A simple command-line chatbot built in Python using OpenAI's GPT models (`gpt-3.5-turbo` or `gpt-4`). This project shows how to use a large language model (LLM) to create a conversational assistant in your terminal.

---

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.7 or newer
- `openai` library

Install the required package:

```bash
pip install openai
```

---

## 🔐 Setup

1. Get your OpenAI API key:  
   https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

2. Set your API key directly in the script:

```python
openai.api_key = "your-api-key-here"
```

Or use an environment variable (recommended):

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

And in your code:

```python
import os
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
```

---

## ▶️ How to Run

Just run the script in your terminal:

```bash
python llm_chatbot.py
```

Example interaction:

```
You: Hello!
Bot: Hello! How can I assist you today?
```

Type `exit` or `quit` to end the chat.

## 🧠 How It Works

The script sends your message to OpenAI's API and returns a response from the GPT model. It uses:

- `gpt-3.5-turbo` or `gpt-4`
- `openai.ChatCompletion` API
- Basic conversation flow

## 💡 Ideas for Expansion

- Add memory (chat history)
- Build a web app (Flask, Streamlit)
- Voice input/output
- Telegram or Discord bot integration
